    events per second:   908.56
P states:
*P0        [2600 MHz]: transition [                1326]

System tasks run on CPU 0, VM runs on CPU 1.

Could not reasonably perform measurements with SmartVMI.
With SmartVMI on CPU 1, ~330us just for timer overhead (breakpoint execution similar)
With SmartVMI on CPU 2, ~180us just for timer overhead
